# Throwaway Git Hub Repository/

This is just a place where I am working with GitHub repositories.

A Markup file (.md) is a text file which uses *markup syntax* to produce a document that others can read online when they check out your repositiory.

I hope to learn the following.

- How to make a repositiory
- how to publish a repositiory using GitHub Desktop
- How to make commits to a repositiory

Let's give it a go :) Also, try out [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.iop/on-demand)
